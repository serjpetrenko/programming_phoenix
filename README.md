# Programming Phoenix Exercises
I started to learn Phoenix framework from the book of author **Dave Thomas**  *Programming Elixir*. This repository contains my solutions to all of the exercises as I work through them. I will try to write them in a manner to where they could be helpful to others in case someone is searching for a solution and finds mine.
